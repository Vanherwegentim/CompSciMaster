**What is a decision variable?**

Decision variables are implicitly existentially quantified: the aim is to find satisfying optimal values in their domain.

**What is consistency?**

Consistency refers to the property of a constraint being satisfied by the current variable assignments. It ensures that the constraints are not violated and that the model is in a valid state

**What is a viewpoint?**



**What is a permutation problem?**



**What are implied constraints?**



**What are redundant decision variables?**



**What is channeling constraint and give an example?**



**What is pre-computation and give an example**



**Explain symmetry and give an example**



**What is symmetry breaking and what kinds are there?**



**What is a propagator and what kinds are there?**



**What is variable selection strategy and what kinds are there?**
